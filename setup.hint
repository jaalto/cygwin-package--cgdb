sdesc: "A curses-based interface to the GNU Debugger (GDB)"
ldesc: "The goal of program is to be lightweight and responsive; not
encumbered with unnecessary features. The interface is designed to
deliver the familiar GDB text interface, with a split screen showing
the source as it executes. The UI is modeled on the classic Unix text
editor, vi. Those familiar with vi should feel right at home using
CGDB."
